# Control Systems Lab ECEN 4638

# Info
* Repository is private since this is for a class
* Kate - you are added as a collaborator and should have access to everything
* There are 3 branches: master, rane, kate
* Each person can work on their branch and then make pull requests to master
* We can add a new folder for each lab
* It is probably a good idea to add matlab scripts and other useful stuff in addition to the lab report
